/// Context object for the majority of compilation.

/// This is a context object that holds a significant portion of the mutable state that is shared between
/// compiler passes (in particular passes that traverse the AST or that convert between the AST and
/// low-level representations).
///
/// It provides some methods for creating definitions and returning [`DefId`]s.  This is partly historical,
/// but also because it's not clear how to move these methods to [`Defs`] where they might conceptually belong.
///
/// # Limitation of scope

//   NOTE: To the future me who is about to delete this section from the documentation:
//         Please consider the examples of concessions in the section.
//         Are you absolutely certain you cannot do something similar to achieve your current goal?
//
/// While there is no doubt a great deal of code which depends on this type (or at least on one or more of
/// its fields), there are a number of phases of compilation that are **forbidden** to depend on this type
/// or any of its fields, just as a matter of principle.  These are:
///
/// * Parsing of text to AST
/// * Formatting of AST to text
/// * Reading binary files to the low-level representation
/// * Writing the low-level representation to a binary file
///
/// There have been numerous instances of things in the past which appeared that they may require breaking
/// this rule, but it has always been found possible to make concessions in favor of keeping this separation.
/// (e.g. [`llir::RawInstr`] holds an args blob so that reading/writing doesn't require signatures.
/// [`crate::passes::resolve_names::assign_res_ids`] allows the parser to not require `Resolutions`, and
/// [`crate::passes::debug::make_idents_unique`] does the same for the formatter)
