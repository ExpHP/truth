  = image was loaded from 'tests/integration/resources/th12-embedded-image-source.anm'
  = you can remove these explicit dimensions to infer them from the image source
  = you can add another image source to override this image
  = you can use `has_image: "dummy"` to ignore the image in the source and generate dummy data
